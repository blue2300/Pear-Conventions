We've got a lot of tools, and they fit together to create a very powerful system that you'll have realised by now can replace your cloud solution.

But bringing all these together into frameworks and libraries in the next step for the community and reduce the complexity of adding P2P to your application.

## [Schema Sheets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/schema-sheets)

> A multiwriter peer-to-peer schema-driven simple database built on Hyperdb. Schema Sheets provides a lightweight time series database where users can query by date ranges and apply JMESPath expressions for flexible data filtering.

Schema Sheets brings together:

* HyperDB
* HyperSchema
* HyperDispatch

In the standard "canonical" way; but provided a simple and intuitive API on top of these. Giving you a `row` based storage system and Schema similar to Schema based Databases.
All with Multi-writer support built-in.
